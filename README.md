Superhero Hunter App
The Superhero Hunter App is a web application that allows users to search for superheroes using the Marvel API and view detailed information about them. Users can search for superheroes, add them to their favorites list, and view their favorite superheroes on a separate page. The app is built using only vanilla JavaScript, and no external libraries or frameworks are used for JavaScript.

Features:
Fetch and display a list of superheroes (characters) on the home page.
Use the Marvel API to search for superheroes based on user input in the search box.
Each search result of the superhero includes an "Add to Favorites" button to add the superhero to the favorites list.
Clicking on a superhero in the main page opens a new page "Superhero Page" with detailed information about the superhero, including their name, photo, bio, comics, series, and more.
Users can view their favorite superheroes on the "My Favorite Superheroes" page.
The favorites list is persistent and stored in the browser's local storage.
Users can remove superheroes from their favorites list.
